`django-massmailer` is a standalone Django app that you can plug in your
website to send e-mails in bulk. It features:

- An **e-mail template engine** to write your e-mail template, supporting both
  plaintext and HTML, with a live preview:

- A **query language** to select the subset of users you want to send e-mails
  to, and preview the list of selected users:

- A **batch status report** that shows how many e-mails have been sent, and is
  able to track bounces.
